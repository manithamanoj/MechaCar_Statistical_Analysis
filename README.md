# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
# Introduction
In this challenge we and the data analytics team is going to review the production data of  Mecha car, which is suffering from production troubles and are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress, to discover insights that may help the manufacturing team. For that we are going to

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

## Results

 According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance as well as intercept are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words the vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on MPG. When an intercept is statistically significant, it means that the intercept term explains a significant amount of variability in the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero.
Depending on our dataset, a significant intercept could mean that the significant features (such as vehicle length and ground clearance) 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots. 
* The suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots

* The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
